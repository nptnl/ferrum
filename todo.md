## **todo list,** in no particular order

Most initial features will be brought over from my Python math library, [PureMath](https://github.com/nptnl/puremath), but new ones will also be created.

---

- polynomial support for complex numbers !!

- the exponential function, optimized, with all type inputs/outputs

- natural logarithm (one branch, of course)

- trigonometry using the exponential

- inverse trig using the logarithm

- rational-number type with fraction simplifying
