## **todo list,** in no particular order

Most initial features will be brought over from my Python math library, [PureMath](https://github.com/nptnl/puremath), but new ones will also be created.

---

- `+ - * /` implementation for `Poly` type

- differentiation and integration for polynomials

- Newton's method to solve functions (including nth-roots of a number)

- polynomial synthetic division to factor-out roots

- full polynomial solving

- the exponential function, optimized, with all type inputs/outputs

- natural logarithm (one branch, of course)

- trigonometry using the exponential

- inverse trig using the logarithm

- rational-number type with fraction simplifying
