## **todo list,** in no particular order

Most initial features will be brought over from my Python math library, [PureMath](https://github.com/nptnl/puremath), but new ones will also be created.

- natural logarithm (one branch, of course), with proper part-splitting and range-fixing

- trigonometry using the exponential

- inverse trig using the logarithm

- rational-number type with fraction simplifying

- multithreaded input space and parameter space fractal rendering for generalized functions

- TI-89 style equation parsing, differentiation, and solving

- 2D coordinate system and line plotting, into terminal or
