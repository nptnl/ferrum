# **Ferrum:** based math has arrived

Ferrum is a Rust math library designed to build some **very cool** math-related functions and projects without relying on other libraries.

In addition to refusing math libraries, I also chose to ignore built-in complex number functionality and the exponentiation operator. Everything here is built from scratch; I like my math completely homemade.

This is a personal project, so new stuff will only be added when I feel like adding it.

## **We have:** *(so far)*

- Complex number and quaternion structs, with `+ - * /` implemented between both these and `f32` real numbers

- Polynomial type with evaluation and `+ - *`
